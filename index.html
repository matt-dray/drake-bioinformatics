* Thank you for being here instead of at rstudioconf
* Entomology MSc and a PhD on ecosystem processes under environmental change
* Over five years in government (Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, Department for Education, Government Digital Service and now the Cabinet Office)
* You can find me in several places
* First things first: I must apologise for two reasons
* You are free to leave if my apology isn't enough

[{drake}](https://docs.ropensci.org/drake/) by [Will Landau](https://wlandau.github.io/)

???
* We're talking about something _much more hip_
* {drake}: the R package built by Will Landau for managing workflows and making your analysis pipeline more reproducible
* It's symbols are a brain and a hammer; I think because {drake} stops you from hammering out your own brain

---
class: middle

ðŸ™‹ Do you: 
--

* use R?

--
* use a workflow manager?

--
* use {drake}?

# Reproducevangelism

???
* Let's define reproducibility

---
class: middle, center

![](img/turing-way-reproducibility.jpg)

From [The Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.com/introduction/introduction) by The Alan Turing Institute

???
* But first we should define reproducibility
* I think we care about reproducing outputs we've aready created (to prove that we can reliably recreate the outcome) and updating with fresh data (like the next quarter's data)
* But I'm going to refer to 'reproducible' throughout

---
class: middle

Can I recreate what you did:
--

* from scratch?
--

* on a different machine?
--

* in the future?
--

* without you present?

???
* A simpler way of thinking about it might be to answer these questions
* Do I have everything I need: code, data, documentation?
* Maybe I don't have the required packages. Maybe I have a different OS.
* Package dependencies and R versions could break things. Are you protected?
* What if you leave your lab group?
* There are lots of tools for this stuff: RMarkdown, {renv}, Docker

[Reproducible Analytical Pipelines](https://ukgovdatascience.github.io/rap-website/) (RAP)

&lt;img src='img/rap_v5_hex.png' width='40%'&gt;

[Can {drake} RAP?](https://www.rostrum.blog/2019/07/23/can-drake-rap/)

???
* In government we recognise the benefits of reproducible analysis and publications via packages and R Markdown
* (But mostly we like 'backronyms')
* We want to make sure the whole end-to-end process from data to publication is repeatable.
* Literally this is a badge of pride in government
* Focus is on code and documentation, writing packages and functions, and using RMarkdown
* I wrote a thing about how {drake} might be useful for RAP in government

---

Can I trust your outputs?

--

Can _you_ trust your outputs?

???
* To be blunt, can I trust your workflow?
* And, possibly more importantly, can you?

---

# Two things

???
* I want to make you thnk about two things

---
class: middle

1. Make workflows reproducible

1. {drake} it to make it

---
class: heading-slide, middle, inverse

# 1. Make workflows reproducible

???
* You have interdependencies of some form
* Multiple files and functions
* Read, wrangle, model, plot, report
* Stuff in, stuff happens, stuff out

---
class: middle

R has [many analytical reproducibility tools](https://annakrystalli.me/talks/r-in-repro-research-dc.html#1)

* [RStudio Projects](https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/02-project-intro/)
* [Packages](https://www.hvitfeldt.me/blog/usethis-workflow-for-package-development/) for reusable code
* [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) for reproducible docs
* [{here}](https://github.com/jennybc/here_here) for relative filepaths
* [{renv}](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html) for dependency management

???
* R has solutions for making your code work on other's machines now and in the future
* They also speed up and can help automate your work
* You can use Git with these to ensure version control too

---
class: middle

What about your analytical _workflow_ itself?

???
* Folks are probably being reproducible already in a number of ways
* But have you thought about making the workflow -- getting from A to B -- reproducible?
* Maybe you have files named `01-read.R`, `02-wrangle.R` -- is that enough?
* Not really -- you still might have to run everything from scratch
* So a system for remembering your workflow would be good

---
class: middle

What if:
--

* you can't remember all the steps?
--

* interdependencies become complex?
--

* you get new data?
--

* you alter some code?
--

* some of your code takes ages to run?

???
* What impact does a change to file 'A' have?
* Do you re-run everything from scratch?
* What if it's time intensive?
* You need something to take care of all this for you

&lt;img src='img/frederik-aust.png' width=70%&gt;

???
* Tweet via [Frederick Aust](https://twitter.com/FrederikAust/status/1205103780938833921?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)
* Consider an example where you have hundreds of files, functions and objects

---

class: middle, center

Consider a workflow manager

&lt;img src='img/awesome.png' width=95%&gt;

<i class="fab  fa-github "></i> [pditommaso/awesome-pipeline](https://github.com/pditommaso/awesome-pipeline)

???
* There are many workflow managers -- some general, some language-specific
* The one that most people might be familiar with is Make (capital 'M')
* So if there's so many then why {drake}?

---
class: heading-slide, middle, inverse

# 2. {drake} it to make it

---
class: middle

Why is {drake} compelling?
--

* it's R-specific
--

* it's free
--

* it has great docs
--

* it meets [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org/)'s rigour
--

* is under active development

???
* rOpenSci is 'carefully vetted, staff- and community-contributed R software tools that lower barriers to working with scientific data sources and data that support research applications on the web'

---
class: middle

It's straightforward to use

1. `drake_plan()`
1. `make()`
1. Change stuff
1. Go to 2

???
* The smallest amount of things you need to do is run two functions
* You create a 'plan' object that' contains the functions, objects and data in your's a bit like a recipe for generating your analysis
* Then you run `make()` on that object to run the steps and 'bake your cake'
* Let's go through a simple, arbitrary, trivial example
* We're not going to think too hard about folder structure in this example
* In fact, this workflow will be running from within this {xaringan} (RMarkdown slides)

---
class: middle, inverse

# Simple demo

&lt;img src='img/beaver.png'&gt;

---
class: middle


```r
library(drake)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(rphylopic)
```

???
* The first couple of steps look like a 'normal' analysis
* First we load the packages we want to use
* {rphylopic} taps into the Phylopic API so we can grab a royalty-free image to adorn our plot

---
class: middle


```r
b_plot &lt;- function(data, image) {
  ggplot(data, aes(id, temp)) +
    geom_boxplot() +
    labs(title = "Weasel temperature") +
    add_phylopic(image)
}

b_table &lt;- function(data) {
  beavers_trim &lt;- data %&gt;% 
    group_by(id) %&gt;% 
    summarise(
      mean = mean(temp), sd = sd(temp),
      min = min(temp), max = max(temp)
    ) %&gt;% ungroup()
  return(beavers_trim)
}
```

???
* And then perhaps we've developed a couple of functions
* Here we have one that plots to particular specifications
* And one that produces a very simple table of descriptive statistics
* The beady-eyed among you may have spotted an error in my functions; keep that in mind

---
class: middle


```r
plan &lt;- drake_plan(
  # wrangle data
  b1 = mutate(beaver1, id = "A"),
  b2 = mutate(beaver2, id = "B"),
  beavers = bind_rows(b1, b2),
  # phylopic image
  uid = "be8670c2-a5bd-4b44-88e8-92f8b0c7f4c6",
  png = image_data(uid, size = "512")[[1]],
  # outputs
  plot = b_plot(beavers, png),
  table = b_table(beavers),
  report = rmarkdown::render(
*   knitr_in("beavers-report.Rmd"),
*   output_file = file_out("beavers-report.html"),
    quiet = TRUE
  )
)
```

???
* Now we bring in `drake_plan()`
* We wrap the steps of the analysis in this function -- wrangling, fetching a phylopic image, building the outputs (a plot, table and RMarkdown report)
* This doesn't look too dissimilar to a regular script file
* Maybe your analyses are similar in terms of reading in data, wrangling it and outputting it in some way
* Particularly if that last step is a thesis or paper

* What does the plan object look like?
* It's a data frame
* Two columns: one for 'targets' and one for 'commands'
* Targets are the things being acted upon and commands are the tasks
* This plan is the key to how {drake} 'remembers' your workflow: it knows the relationships between all the steps and the order they're in
* So far we haven't built anything, we've just created the receipe

???
* We can revisit the network graph to get a visual representation of the impact of our change
* You can now see that the colour of some targets has turned black
* These are the targets that are now out of date
* {drake} remembered this to you didn't have to

---
class: middle


```r
drake::make(plan)
```
```
## target plot
## target report
```


???
* Of course, we can now re-`make()` the plan
* {drake} will only update the things that have been impacted by our change
* This is a trivial example -- consider how helpful this would be if you had even more targets and more complicated relationships, especially if you have steps that are computationally-intensive

&lt;iframe src="https://matt-dray.github.io/drake-bioinformatics/beavers-report.html" width="100%" height="500"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

???
* And we can peak at the rendered R Markdown once more to check that our change to the plot function had its desired effect

To recap
--

1. `drake_plan()`
--

1. `make()`
--

1. Change stuff
--

1. Go to 2

???
* Let's recap those steps again
* Create a plan with targets and commands -- it's a dataframe
* Make that plan to run the analysis
* Something changes -- input data, function specifications, etc
* (You can check what's outdated and check the network graph)
* Now re-`make()`
* And you can do this over and over

# What now?

class: middle

What wasn't covered

* target-creation history
* recovery
* high-performance computing
* static and dynamic branching
* time prediction
* memory strategies
* trigger customisation

???
* Clearly there isn't enough time to go through all the great things about {drake}
* Luckily {drake} has rich documentation
