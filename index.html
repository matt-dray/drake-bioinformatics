* We're talking about something _much more hip_
* {drake}: the R package built by Will Landau for managing workflows and making your analysis pipeline more reproducible
* It's symbols are a brain and a hammer; I think because {drake} stops you from hammering out your own brain

---
class: middle

Do you: 
--

* use R?

--
* use a workflow manager?

--
* use {drake}?

--
* have FOMO about these things?

???
* Let's get to know wach other. 
* Hands-up

# Reproducivangelism

---
class: middle

I want to convince you of two things:

1. Make your workflow reproducible
1. {drake} it to make it

---
class: middle, center

![](img/turing-way-reproducibility.jpg)

From [The Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.com/introduction/introduction) by The Alan Turing Institute

???
* But first we should define reproducibility
* I think we care about reproducing outputs we've aready created (to prove that we can reliably recreate the outcome) and updating with fresh data (like the next quarter's data)
* But I'm going to refer to 'reproducible' throughout

---
class: middle

Can I recreate what you did:
--

* from scratch?
--

* on a different machine?
--

* in the future?
--

* without you present?

???
* A simpler way of thinking about it might be to answer these questions
* Do I have everything I need: code, data, documentation?
* Maybe I don't have the required packages. Maybe I have a different OS.
* Package dependencies and R versions could break things. Are you protected?
* What if you leave your lab group?
* There are lots of tools for this stuff: RMarkdown, {renv}, Docker

???
* In government we recognise the benefits of reproducible analysis and publications via packages and R Markdown
* (But mostly we like 'backronyms')
* We want to make sure the whole end-to-end process from data to publication is repeatable.
* Literally this is a badge of pride in government
* Focus is on code and documentation, writing packages and functions, and using RMarkdown

Can I trust your outputs?

# Two things

???
* I want to convince you of two things
* I think there are people in the room who know all this
* I think there are people in the room who don't know what they're missing

---
class: middle

1. Use a workflow manager

2. Use {drake} to do it

---
class: heading-slide, middle, inverse

# 1. Use a workflow manager

???
* You have interdependencies of some form
* Multiple files and functions
* Read, wrangle, model, plot, report
* Stuff in, stuff happens, stuff out

---
class: middle

But why?

???
* Interdependencies become too complex
* You can't record them easily

---
class: middle

What if something changes?

???
* What impact does a change to file 'A' have?
* Do you re-run everything from scratch?
* What if it's time intensive?

---
class: middle

You need a workflow manager

class: middle, center

&lt;img src='img/awesome.png'&gt;

[pditommaso/awesome-pipeline](https://github.com/pditommaso/awesome-pipeline)

???
* There are many workflow managers -- some general, some language-specific
* The one that most people might be familiar with is Make (capital 'M')
* So if there's so many then why {drake}?

---
class: heading-slide, middle, inverse

# Why {drake}?

---
class: middle

Why is {drake} compelling?

* R-specific
* free
* great docs
* meets [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org/)'s rigour
* peer-reviewed
* under active development
* Will Landau himself


---
class: middle

{drake} is straightforward

1. `drake_plan()`
1. `make()`
1. Change stuff
1. Go to 2

???
* The smallest amount of things you need to do is run two functions
* You create a 'plan' object that' contains the functions, objects and data in your's a bit like a recipe for generating your analysis
* Then you run `make()` on that object to run the steps and 'bake your cake'
* Let's go through a simple, arbitrary, trivial example
* We're not going to think too hard about folder structure in this example
* In fact, this workflow will be running from within this {xaringan} (RMarkdown slides)

---
class: middle, inverse

# Simple demo

---
class: middle


```r
library(drake)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(rphylopic)
```

???
* The first couple of steps look like a 'normal' analysis
* First we load the packages we want to use
* {rphylopic} taps into the Phylopic API so we can grab a royalty-free image to adorn our plot

---
class: middle


```r
b_plot &lt;- function(data, image) {
  ggplot(data, aes(id, temp)) +
    geom_boxplot() +
    labs(title = "Weasel temperature") +
    add_phylopic(image)
}

b_table &lt;- function(data) {
  beavers_trim &lt;- data %&gt;% 
    group_by(id) %&gt;% 
    summarise(
      mean = mean(temp), sd = sd(temp),
      min = min(temp, max = max(temp))
      ) %&gt;% ungroup()
  return(beavers_trim)
}
```

???
* And then perhaps we've developed a couple of functions
* Here we have one that plots to particular specifications
* And one that produces a very simple table of descriptive statistics
* The beady-eyed among you may have spotted an error in my functions; keep that in mind

---
class: middle


```r
plan &lt;- drake_plan(
  # wrangle data
  b1 = mutate(beaver1, id = "A"),
  b2 = mutate(beaver2, id = "B"),
  beavers = bind_rows(b1, b2),
  # phylopic image
  uid = "be8670c2-a5bd-4b44-88e8-92f8b0c7f4c6",
  png = image_data(uid, size = "512")[[1]],
  # outputs
  plot = b_plot(beavers, png),
  table = b_table(beavers),
  report = rmarkdown::render(
*   knitr_in("beavers-report.Rmd"), quiet = TRUE,
*   output_file = file_out("beavers-report.html")
  )
)
```

???
* Now we bring in `drake_plan()`
* We wrap the steps of the analysis in this function -- wrangling, fetching a phylopic image, building the outputs (a plot, table and RMarkdown report)
* This doesn't look too dissimilar to a regular script file
* Maybe your analyses are similar in terms of reading in data, wrangling it and outputting it in some way
* Particularly if that last step is a thesis or paper

* What does the plan object look like?
* It's a data frame
* Two columns: one for 'targets' and one for 'commands'
* Targets are the things being acted upon and commands are the tasks
* This plan is the key to how {drake} 'remembers' your workflow: it knows the relationships between all the steps and the order they're in
* So far we haven't built anything, we've just created the receipe

???
* You can now see that the colour of some targets has turned black
* These are the targets that are now out of date
* {drake} remembered this to you didn't have to

```r
drake::make(plan)
```
```
## target plot
## target report
```

???
* Of course, we can now re-`make()` the plan
* {drake} will only update the things that have been impacted by our change
* This is a trivial example -- consider how helpful this would be if you had even more targets and more complicated relationships, especially if you have steps that are computationally-intensive

???
* And we can peak at the rendered R Markdown once more to check that our change to the plot function had its desired effect

1. `drake_plan()`
1. `make()`
1. Change stuff
1. Go to 2

???
* Let's recap those steps again
* Create a plan with targets and commands -- it's a dataframe
* Make that plan to run the analysis
* Something changes -- input data, function specifications, etc
* (You can check what's outdated and check the network graph)
* Now re-`make()`
* And you can do this over and over

# What now?

What wasn't covered:

* high-performance computing
* parallelism
* dynamic branching
* other cool stuff

???
* Clearly there isn't enough time to go through all the great things about {drake}
* Just try it
* Luckily {drake} has rich documentation
