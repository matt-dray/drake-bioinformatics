Why I care

???
* What I care about: reproducibility and automation of government publications
* Reproducible Analytcal Pipelines (RAP)
* We're building packages, but what do we do about analytical workflows?

What's a reproducible workflow?

---
class: middle

What do I mean by workflow?

???
* You have interdependencies of some form
* Multiple files and functions
* Read, wrangle, model, plot, report
* Stuff in, stuff happens, stuff out

---

What's the problem?

???
* Interdependencies become too complex
* You can't record them easily

---

<Insert tweet with complicated interdependencies>

What if something changes?

???
* What impact does a change to file 'A' have?
* Do you re-run everything from scratch?
* What if it's time intensive?
