* Instead, we're talking {drake}, an R package built by Will Landau for managing workflows and making your analysis pipeline more reproducible

---
class: middle

Do you: 
--

* use R?

--
* use a workflow manager?

--
* use {drake}?

--
* have FOMO about these things?

???
* Hands-up
* If the terms mean nothing to you then obviously keep your hand down

# Reproducivangelism

class: middle

I want to convince you of two things:

1. Make your workflow reproducible
1. {drake} it to make it

![](img/turing-way-reproducibility.jpg)

From [The Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.com/introduction/introduction) by The Alan Turing Institute

???
* But first we should define reproducibility
* I think we care about reproducing outputs we've aready created (to prove that we can reliably recreate the outcome) and updating with fresh data (like the next quarter's data)
* But I'm going to refer to 'reproducible' throughout

---
class: middle

Can I recreate what you did:
--

* from scratch?
--

* on a different machine?
--

* in the future?
--

* without you present?

???
* A simpler way of thinking about it might be to answer these questions
* Do I have everything I need: code, data, documentation?
* Maybe I don't have the required packages. Maybe I have a different OS.
* Package dependencies and R versions could break things. Are you protected?
* What if you leave your lab group?
* There are lots of tools for this stuff: RMarkdown, {renv}, Docker

???
* In government we recognise the benefits of reproducible analysis and publications via packages and R Markdown
* (But mostly we like 'backronyms')
* We want to make sure the whole end-to-end process from data to publication is repeatable.
* Literally this is a badge of pride in government
* Focus is on code and documentation, writing packages and functions, and using RMarkdown

# Two things

???
* I want to convince you of two things
* I think there are people in the room who know all this
* I think there are people in the room who don't know what they're missing

---
class: middle

1. Use a workflow manager

2. Use {drake} to do it

---
class: heading-slide, middle, inverse

# 1. Use a workflow manager

???
* You have interdependencies of some form
* Multiple files and functions
* Read, wrangle, model, plot, report
* Stuff in, stuff happens, stuff out

---
class: middle

But why?

???
* Interdependencies become too complex
* You can't record them easily

---
class: middle

What if something changes?

???
* What impact does a change to file 'A' have?
* Do you re-run everything from scratch?
* What if it's time intensive?

---
class: middle

Why is {drake} compelling?

* you already work in R
* you don't have to learn aything els
* version controllable
* free
* great docs
* peer reviewed
* under active development

---
class: middle

1. `drake_plan()`
1. `make()`
1. Change stuff
1. Go to 2
