# drake-bioinformatics

This repo contains slides for a talk about the {drake} package at a [London Bioinformatics Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/en-AU/Bioinformatics-London/events/ksqwtmybccbnc/){target="_blank"} on 30 January 2020.

## Workflow management

The {drake} package by [Will Landau](https://wlandau.github.io/){target="_blank"} is an R-focused solution for managing your analytical workflows. 

What does that mean? {drake} 'remembers' the relationships between objects in your workflow. When you update your analysis, {drake} makes sure that only the impacted objects are re-run. This means you don't have to recreate everything from scratch each time.
