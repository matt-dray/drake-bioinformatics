Workflow management
-------------------

The {drake} package by
<a href="https://wlandau.github.io/" target="_blank">Will Landau</a> is
an R-focused solution for managing your analytical workflows.

What does that mean? {drake} ‘remembers’ the relationships between
objects in your workflow. When you update your analysis, {drake} makes
sure that only the impacted objects are re-run. This means you don’t
have to recreate everything from scratch each time.
